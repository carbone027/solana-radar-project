## How to Use 👨‍💻👩‍💻

### 1. Login and Authentication 🔑
Authentication will be provided by the 36'Oracle support team, who will send the necessary credentials via email. Once you receive this information, access our [login portal](www.google.com.br) and log in, allowing you to use all the features of our services.

### 2. AI Training 🤖
AI training is automatically carried out by the system based on the data provided via **XML**. For more details on the process, check out the [How It Works](#how-it-works) section.

#### 2.1. Data Upload
Upload your customer database using a **XML** file and define the tags corresponding to the column names. This dataset will be used by the AI for training, enabling the system to learn and categorize customers accurately and personally. Every step of the data upload and processing, including AI training, will be recorded on the **Solana** blockchain, ensuring total transparency, auditability, and data security throughout the process.

#### 2.2. Feature Selection
Choose and input the features you want to use in the AI model to optimize the training process and obtain the best predictions based on the data provided.

#### 2.3. Conclusion
After the feature selection and training process, the AI will process and categorize the customers, optimizing them for future analyses. All results can be verified on the blockchain.

### 3. Prediction 🎯

Predictions and recommendations are generated by AI through the analysis of the provided data, allowing for informed decisions based on patterns identified in the customer profiles.

#### 3.1 Customer Data Submission
Make an HTTP request with the customer data to obtain the investor profile. The AI will process the information and return the customer’s investor type in the request response.

#### 3.2 Prediction Reading
After submission, the AI will generate predictions based on the provided data. The bank can make an HTTP request to directly receive the customer's investor type, ensuring personalized investment recommendations.

## How It Works 🔧

### 1. Data Reception 📦

The data reception process involves sending a list of tags and a **[XML](https://www.w3.org/XML/)** file containing a dataframe. The API processes this information as follows:

- The **tags** are used to define the columns of the dataframe.
- The content of the **XML** file is transformed into a dataframe, using the tags as column headers.

Once the dataframe is generated, the API begins training the **[RandomForest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)** model, using the tag-derived columns as attributes and the XML data as content. Every step of the processing is recorded on the blockchain to ensure that the entire flow is transparent and auditable.

### 2. AI Model Training 🧠

AI training occurs automatically after data reception and dataframe preparation. The **RandomForest** model is adjusted based on the provided data, identifying patterns and creating a predictive model. With each new dataset submitted, the model is refined and optimized to improve prediction accuracy, with all adjustments and results stored on the blockchain.

- The AI learns from the provided data, adjusting its parameters based on the information contained in the dataframe.
- The model is evaluated to ensure proper functionality.
- If the model's performance meets accuracy criteria, it is used for future predictions, and the investor profile is returned via HTTP, with all performance records stored on the blockchain.

### 4. Categorization and Prediction 🔢

Categorization and prediction are dynamically performed by the model. AI identifies patterns based on training and validation data, optimizing the process with **RandomForest** to minimize errors and maximize accuracy. Each generated result is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring **total transparency**.

---

### 5. Request Customer Investor Type 📝
Make an HTTP request to obtain all the information about the customer's investor profile. The data is processed by AI using the decision tree system, ensuring an accurate and personalized classification.

---

## Use Case Examples 💡:

### AI Training
The entire AI training process, including the provided data and model stages, is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring that the entire history is immutable and transparent.

### Data Submission
Data submission for training and prediction can be audited through the hashes generated by the blockchain, ensuring data integrity.

### Data Processing
The data processed by AI can be verified and audited on the blockchain, ensuring that the information is correct and has not been altered.

### Customer Categorization
Customer categorization performed by AI can be tracked and verified on the blockchain, ensuring that the classification was done accurately and auditable.
