## How to Use üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª

### 1. Login and Authentication üîë

Authentication is done with a password generated by the **36'Oracle** support team, sent via email. After receiving the credentials, access our [login portal](www.google.com.br).

### 2. AI Training ü§ñ

The AI training process is technically automated by the **API** with the data provided in **XML** format, converted to **JSON** for compatibility and integration with machine learning models. Data is processed, categorized, and used for predictions according to the steps below.

#### 2.1 Data Submission
The data is submitted in an **XML** file with the columns appropriately defined. The file is transformed into a **dataframe** for processing.

#### 2.2 Feature Selection
The **features** are selected based on their relevance to the model. Selection is done automatically using the **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** technique, which evaluates the most important attributes for prediction.

#### 2.3 Training Process
The model training process follows these steps:

1. **Transformation into DataFrame**: The data is converted into tabular format, facilitating processing.
2. **Categorical Variable Conversion**: Categorical variables are converted into numerical values.
3. **Normalization of Numerical Columns**: Numerical data is normalized to maintain a uniform scale for the model.
4. **Model Training**: The **RandomForest** algorithm is used, dynamically adjusted to optimize predictions.
5. **Model Saving and Export**: The trained model is saved and exported for future predictions.
6. **Blockchain Registration**: The entire process, from data submission to predictions, is recorded on the **blockchain**, ensuring transparency and security.

### 3. Prediction üéØ

Predictions are generated in real-time by the AI based on the analyzed data, using **RandomForest**. The system returns the investor profile of each customer, helping banks offer strategic recommendations.

#### 3.1 Submitting Customer Data
To obtain predictions, send an **HTTP** request via **GraphQL**.

#### 3.2 Prediction Generation and Review
The AI processes the data, classifies the investor profile, and returns the predictions. The entire process is recorded on the **blockchain**.

---

### 4. Conclusion üèÅ

After processing, you will have access to the customer investor profile predictions, with all data transactions auditable on the **blockchain**.

## How It Works üîß
<a name="how-it-works"></a>

### 1. Data Reception üì¶

Data is received in **XML** format and transformed into a **dataframe** for processing.

---

### 2. AI Model Training üß†

Training follows these steps:

1. **Transformation into DataFrame**.
2. **Categorical Variable Conversion** into numerical representations.
3. **Normalization of Numerical Columns**.
4. **Model Training** with **RandomForest** and **RFE** technique.
5. **Customer Categorization and Prediction**.
6. **Model Saving and Export**.
7. **Blockchain Registration**.

## Usage Examples üí°

### 1. AI Training

Suppose you receive a bank's customer database containing their transactions. After submitting this data in **XML** format, **36'Oracle** automatically converts the data, processes the categorical and numerical variables, and trains the AI model based on the detected patterns. The model classifies the investor profile of each customer.

### 2. Data Submission

To submit new customer data, use the **GraphQL** interface. The AI will process the data and return a real-time prediction of the investor profile, allowing the bank to provide appropriate investment recommendations.

### 3. Data Processing

When the data is submitted, **36'Oracle** automatically cleans and organizes the information, removing missing values, normalizing numerical columns, and categorizing variables to ensure efficient and accurate AI training.

### 4. Customer Categorization

After training, customers are classified according to their investor profiles using algorithms like **RandomForest**. This allows banks to segment customers based on their risk appetite and offer personalized financial products.
